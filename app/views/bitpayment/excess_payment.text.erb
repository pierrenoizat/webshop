Payment received: excess payment

Dear <%= @invoice.name %>
This is just to let you know that we've received your payment for your recent order.
Your order will be shipped soon to your address:
<%= "#{@invoice.adresse} | " + "#{@invoice.city} | " + "#{@invoice.zip_code} | " + "#{@invoice.country} " %>
 
Please note that your payment exceeded the balance due for your order.
You may request from us a refund for the difference, up to 30 days after this notification.
After 30 days, if we do not hear from you, the amount paid in excess of the order will be considered a donation to our project.
Thanks !
